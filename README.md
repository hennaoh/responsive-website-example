## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

So far this is what it looks like:

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### To Do

- Add corners to the mobile design.
- Figure out a way for `border-radius` to work in the Flex `.container` instead of doing it in the individual items.
- Figure out the proper size and centering for the 'Add to Cart' button.
- Add interactive elements (_hover_ and _focus_).
- Figure out why `src : local()` doesn't work even though I have Montserrat installed.


### Resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://www.css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox) - Really helped with understanding what works and where stuff should go and why. Unfortunately doesn't explain why `justify content` doesn't work.
- [MDN CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) - Very helpful for looking up properties and values. It also has examples, which helped a lot.
